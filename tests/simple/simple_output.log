Analyzing 'tests/simple/simple.fasta'.
Flags are --IQR_coefficient: 1.0, -subsample_size: 4, --gap_percent_cut: 2.0
Input alignment length is: 32 characters.
Input alignment depth is: 4 sequences.
Generating sequence dataframe.
Calculating Shannon entropy values and gap metrics across all input sequences.
Printed gap distribution of input alignment to file: tests/simple/simple_gap_plot.pdf
Maximum Shannon entropy alignment score before gap % considered: 1.5
Maximum Shannon entropy alignment score after gap % considered: 1.5
Removing gapped positions from analysis set.
Elapsed time: ~ 0 seconds.
Alignment positions analyzed after 2.0% gap cutoff: 8
Preparing sequences for comparison.
Beginning sequence trials.
Printed median values of sequence comparisons from full analysis to file tests/simple/simple_median_plot.pdf
Elapsed time: ~ 0 seconds.
Estimated total time for analysis: ~ 0 seconds.
Cut-off value for median taken across comparisons (full-alignment pairwise analysis): 9.0
Writing cleaned alignment as FASTA.
